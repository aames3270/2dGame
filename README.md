# 2dGame
This is my 2D game individual project for CS583-01:3D Game Programming

Originally the player character was suppose to be a mouse but I changed to a space ship.
The falling objects were suppose to be chickens but I changed them to stars.
I wanted to make a game that reflected the music I was listening to at the moment, ambient.
I also wanted to make something reasonable... This is the first game I have ever made.
Controls were originally suppose to through a mouse but I changed it to arrow keys.
Spacebar starts the game at the start screen. After "Game Over," hit "R" to restart 
the game.
